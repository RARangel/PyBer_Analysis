# Module 5: PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
The objective is to provide a summary DataFrame of the PyBer ride-sharing data by city type.
This report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Deliverables
Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type: Chart: [file](analysis/Stats_per_City_Type_Chart.PNG).

Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. Plot: [file](PyBer_fare_summary.png).

Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

### Resources

## Results
### Analysis
Urban cities collected the highest total fares ($39,854.38), but rural cities had the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and highest fares per driver ($55.49). 
Overall, the urban type cities collected the most fares during the sample time period. Rides/fares peaked in lae February for all three types.
